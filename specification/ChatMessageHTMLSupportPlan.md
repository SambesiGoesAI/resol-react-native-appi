# Specification: Support for HTML Tags in Chat Message Replies

## Objective
Enable the Alpo app to safely render HTML tags in chat message replies, allowing formatted content to be displayed in the chat UI.

## Current Behavior
- Chat messages are rendered as plain text using React Native's `<Text>` component.
- HTML tags in message text are displayed as raw text, not interpreted or formatted.
- Message text is stored and retrieved without sanitization or processing of HTML content.

## Proposed Enhancement

### Overview
Introduce support for rendering HTML content in chat messages by integrating an HTML rendering library and sanitizing incoming HTML to prevent security risks.

### Detailed Plan

1. **Library Selection**
   - Investigate and select a React Native library capable of rendering HTML content, such as `react-native-render-html`.
   - Ensure the library supports the required HTML tags and styles needed for chat messages.

2. **Message Content Detection**
   - Modify the `ChatMessage` component to detect if the message text contains HTML tags.
   - If no HTML tags are present, render as plain text for performance.

3. **Sanitization**
   - Implement sanitization of HTML content to prevent XSS and other security vulnerabilities.
   - Use a trusted sanitization library or implement custom sanitization rules.
   - Ensure sanitization occurs before rendering and before storing messages if applicable.

4. **Rendering**
   - Replace or augment the current plain text rendering in `ChatMessage` with the HTML rendering component.
   - Pass sanitized HTML content to the renderer.
   - Maintain existing styling and theming compatibility.

5. **Testing**
   - Test rendering with various HTML inputs including:
     - Basic formatting tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`)
     - Links and images (if supported)
     - Nested tags and complex HTML structures
   - Verify that no raw HTML tags appear in the UI.
   - Confirm that sanitization effectively blocks malicious content.

6. **Backend and Storage Considerations**
   - Review chat message storage and transmission to ensure HTML content is preserved correctly.
   - Optionally sanitize or validate HTML content on the backend or before saving to the database.

## Security Considerations
- Sanitization is critical to prevent injection attacks.
- Avoid rendering untrusted HTML without proper sanitization.
- Regularly update sanitization libraries to patch vulnerabilities.

## Deliverables
- Updated `ChatMessage` component supporting HTML rendering.
- Sanitization logic integrated into message processing.
- Documentation of the new behavior and any limitations.
- Test cases covering HTML rendering and security.
