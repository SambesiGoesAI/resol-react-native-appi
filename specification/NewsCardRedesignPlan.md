### Plan: Modify News Card Layout

1.  **Analyze `NewsCard.tsx`**: I will start by reading the contents of `src/components/NewsCard.tsx` to understand its current structure, styling, and how it displays the news image, header, and text.

2.  **Restructure Card Content**: I will modify the JSX in `NewsCard.tsx` to change the rendering order of the elements to:
    1.  Image (`<Image>`)
    2.  Header (`<Text>` or a custom component)
    3.  News Text (`<Text>` or a custom component)

3.  **Apply New Styles**: I will update the `StyleSheet` within `NewsCard.tsx` to implement the following changes:
    *   **Content Alignment**: Create a new container style for the image, header, and text elements that sets their `width` to `80%` and centers them horizontally within the card.
    *   **Image Shadow**: Add `shadow` properties (`shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`) to the image's style to create a dropdown shadow effect.

4.  **Review and Verify**: After applying the changes, I will present the modified code. You will need to run the application to visually verify that the new layout matches the requirements.
