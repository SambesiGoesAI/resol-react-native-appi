# Role-Based News Filtering Implementation - Completion Summary

## Task Overview
Implemented role-based news filtering for the AlpoApp to ensure users only see news from housing companies they have access to.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Authentication Service ✅
**File**: `src/services/auth.ts`
- Added `housing_companies` field to User interface
- Modified `signInWithAccessCode` to fetch user's housing company relationships
- Successfully queries `user_housing_companies` table and includes IDs in user object

### Phase 2: News Service ✅
**File**: `src/services/newsService.ts`
- Added `housing_company_id` and `housing_companies` to SupabaseNewsItem interface
- Implemented `fetchNewsForHousingCompanies` method for filtered news fetching
- Updated `transformSupabaseData` to include housing company information
- Modified `fetchNewsSince` to support optional housing company filtering

### Phase 3: News Hook ✅
**File**: `src/services/useNews.ts`
- Added `user` parameter to UseNewsConfig interface
- Updated `loadNews` logic to use `fetchNewsForHousingCompanies` when user has housing companies
- Implemented proper error handling for users without housing company access
- Updated mock data filtering to respect user's housing companies

### Phase 4: Background Sync ✅
**File**: `src/services/backgroundSync.ts`
- Added `user` field to SyncConfig interface
- Updated `performSync` to filter news based on user's housing companies
- Implemented `mergeNews` method for proper news item deduplication
- Both incremental and full sync now respect housing company filtering

### Phase 5: UI Screen ✅
**File**: `src/screens/UutisetScreen.tsx`
- Added user state management with AsyncStorage
- Implemented proper loading states for user data
- Pass user context to useNews hook
- Added appropriate error messages and empty states

### Additional Updates ✅
**File**: `src/services/mockAuth.ts`
- Added `housing_companies` field to MockUser interface
- Updated mock users with test housing company IDs:
  - ADMIN123: Access to companies 'aaaaaaaa...' and 'bbbbbbbb...'
  - USER456: Access to company 'bbbbbbbb...'
  - GUEST789: Access to company 'cccccccc...'

## Testing Scenarios

### With Mock Data (No Supabase)
1. **Admin User (ADMIN123)**: Sees news from Keskuskatu 1 and Puistotie 5
2. **Regular User (USER456)**: Sees only news from Puistotie 5
3. **Guest User (GUEST789)**: Sees only news from Rantakatu 10

### With Supabase
1. **ACCESSCODE1**: Has access to Keskuskatu 1 and Puistotie 5
2. **ACCESSCODE2**: Has access to Puistotie 5 only
3. **ACCESSCODE3**: Has access to Rantakatu 10 only

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Database-Level Filtering**: All queries filter by housing_company_id at the database level
2. **User Context Propagation**: User object with housing companies flows through all layers
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to cached/mock data on errors
4. **Background Sync Support**: Incremental updates respect user's housing company access
5. **Mock Data Support**: Full testing capability without Supabase connection

## Security Considerations

- ✅ No client-side filtering of sensitive data - all filtering happens at database level
- ✅ User can only see news from explicitly assigned housing companies
- ✅ Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- ✅ No housing companies = no news (secure default)

## Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ✅ News caching mechanism preserved
- ✅ Background sync only fetches relevant news
- ✅ Incremental sync reduces data transfer

## Authentication Approach

The app uses a custom access code authentication system rather than Supabase's built-in authentication:
- Users log in with access codes (e.g., ACCESSCODE1, ADMIN123)
- User data is fetched from the database using the access code
- Session management is handled via AsyncStorage, not Supabase Auth
- This avoids complexity with email/password management while maintaining security

## Next Steps

The role-based news filtering is now fully implemented and ready for testing. The system will:
1. Authenticate users and fetch their housing company assignments
2. Filter all news queries to show only relevant content
3. Handle edge cases gracefully (no assignments, network errors, etc.)
4. Maintain performance through caching and incremental updates

## Testing Instructions

1. **Mock Mode**: Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL' or leave it empty
   - Test with access codes: ADMIN123, USER456, GUEST789
   
2. **Supabase Mode**: Configure proper Supabase credentials
   - Test with access codes: ACCESSCODE1, ACCESSCODE2, ACCESSCODE3

The implementation ensures that users will only see news relevant to their assigned housing companies, maintaining data privacy and relevance.
