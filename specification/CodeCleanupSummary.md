# Code Cleanup and Refactoring Summary

## Date: November 6, 2025

### Overview
This document summarizes the code cleanup and refactoring performed on the AlpoApp codebase to remove all debug/log code and improve code quality.

### Debug Code Removed

#### 1. App.tsx
- Removed 3 `console.error` statements:
  - Line 40: Error checking auth status
  - Line 51: Error loading dark mode preference  
  - Line 61: Error saving dark mode preference

#### 2. src/services/auth.ts
- Removed 5 `console.log` statements:
  - Line 20: Auth attempt logging
  - Line 29: User fetch error logging
  - Line 40: Housing companies fetch error logging
  - Line 47: Fetched user data logging
  - Line 62: Exception during sign-in logging

#### 3. src/screens/UutisetScreen.tsx
- Removed 1 `console.error` statement:
  - Line 22: Failed to load user error

#### 4. src/services/useNews.ts
- Removed 5 console statements:
  - Line 105: `console.error` - Background sync error
  - Line 152: `console.log` - Loading news for user
  - Line 160: `console.log` - Fetched news count
  - Line 165: `console.log` - No housing companies assigned
  - Line 173: `console.error` - Failed to load news

### Type Safety Improvements

#### 1. Replaced `any` types with proper `User` type:
- **App.tsx**: 
  - Updated state type from `useState<any>` to `useState<User | null>`
  - Updated `handleLoginSuccess` parameter type from `any` to `User`
  - Added `User` import from auth service

- **AlpoScreen.tsx**: 
  - Updated `user` prop type from `any` to `User | null`
  - Added `User` import

- **AsetuksetScreen.tsx**: 
  - Updated `user` prop type from `any` to `User | null`
  - Added `User` import

- **LockScreen.tsx**: 
  - Updated `onLoginSuccess` callback parameter type from `any` to `User`
  - Added `User` import

- **TabNavigator.tsx**: 
  - Updated `user` prop type from `any` to `User | null`
  - Added `User` import

#### 2. NewsCard Component:
- Removed duplicate `NewsItem` interface definition
- Now imports `NewsItem` from `useNews` service for consistency
- Updated image handling to support both `image_url` and `imagePath` properties
- Removed unused imports (`TouchableOpacity`, `LayoutChangeEvent`)

### Code Quality Observations

#### Strengths:
- Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent use of TypeScript for type safety
- Good component organization (screens, services, components)
- Proper error handling with silent fails where appropriate
- Clean styling patterns using StyleSheet
- Dark mode support throughout the app

#### Areas for Future Improvement:
1. Consider implementing a centralized error logging service for production
2. Add more comprehensive error boundaries for React components
3. Consider implementing proper loading states in more components
4. Add unit tests for services and components
5. Consider extracting common styles to a shared styles module

### Files Modified:
1. App.tsx
2. src/services/auth.ts
3. src/screens/UutisetScreen.tsx
4. src/services/useNews.ts
5. src/screens/AlpoScreen.tsx
6. src/screens/AsetuksetScreen.tsx
7. src/screens/LockScreen.tsx
8. src/navigation/TabNavigator.tsx
9. src/components/NewsCard.tsx

### Result:
All console.log, console.error, and other debug statements have been removed from the codebase. Type safety has been improved by replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript types. The code is now cleaner and production-ready.
